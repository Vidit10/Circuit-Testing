- Implement NAND(X) - till 7
- fault simulation algorithm ("each node" detail is required) - 2nd
    - some node might always be stuck at 0 or 1
    - erroneous output
- 11 - branching into 2 (special case and care to be given)
    - 
- Functional simulation - try all inputs and map all the outputs (initial target) - show the node values as well
